# The following algorithm may be used to carry out multiplication of two positive numbers M and N by repeated addition. 
Initialize product to 0 (put 0 in CX)
REPEAT 
add M to product 
decrement N UNTIL N equals 0 

Write a sequence of instructions to multiply AX by BX, and put the product in CX. You may ignore the possibility of overflow.
